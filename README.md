# LTSpiceBuckBoostAutomation

This script automates LTSpice simulations and organizes the resulting data. It iterates through thousands of parameter combinations for both cascaded buck-boost and boost-buck converters. After each run, the simulation results are automatically saved to an Excel file. The script then generates dozens of charts to make the data easy to read and compare.
