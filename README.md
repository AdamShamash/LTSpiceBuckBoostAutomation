# LTSpiceBuckBoostAutomation

This file contains code that automatics the simulating and data organization aspects of LTSpice. It is used to iterate through thousands of parameter options for a cascaded buck-boost converter
and a cascaded boost-buck converter. The program then automatically saves the simulation data to an excel file and plots the data on dozens of different charts combinations for easy readability
and organization
